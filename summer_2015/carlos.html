	<p>I am a 28 years old Spaniard, currently living in France. For the last <b>seven years</b> I have lived in 8 different countries all around the world (China, UAE, Finland, Australia, Algeria, Canada, Germany, France) and I am now working as an aerospace consultant for the top executives of Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer.</p>

	<p>I love travelling, experiencing different cultures, water and winter sports, adventure, languages, and I am deeply passionate about how technology is changing the world for the better. I contineously chase opportunities that would make me be part of that change.</p>

  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>It was back in 1999, when I was 13 years old. I remember perfectly the moment my parents and I discuss whether to suscribe to the internet provider or not. At the time, I did not really know what the Internet was, but when it arrived  home, I was fascinated. A few months later, I asked my parents to purchase <b>Microsoft Frontage</b> and a <b>Javascript book</b> for me to create my first websites.</p>
  <p>My passion for coding and "the Web" started...</p>
  <H2>I took the "wrong" choice</h2> 
  <p>At age 17, I needed to decide what highger education I wanted to get into. My inside was clearly stating <b>"Computer Engineering"</b>, but then my social circle at the time was saying something different: <i>"Computer Engineering is for nerds! You are smarter and deserve better than that."</i> Everytime I think about it I cannot stop laughing and simling. I decided then to follow a different path that I really enjoyed as well: <b>Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering. </b></p>

  <p>Ten years after starting University, I had a great career in the Aerospace Industry (Airbus), did my MBA in a top business school, fully sponsored, etc. <br> But one thing kept repeting itself during the last years: <b>CODING</b>.</p>
  <p>During the last years, I identified 14 different moments in my life where I coded software to solve problems, whether at university, at work, or during my freetime on the weekends. Some of those include:<br>
  	<ul>
	  <li>First website aged 13 (HTML, PHP, Javscript)</li>
	  <li>Coded an Structural Stress program for Casio calculators at university, just for fun</li>
	  <li>Developped web apps with <a href="https://www.zoho.com/creator/">ZOHO Creator</a> for my university student association to manage members and subscriptions</li>
	  <li>Had my own blog at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100117040348/http://www.carlosld.es/">www.carlosld.com</a> and experiment Internet Marketing, SEO and SEM, GoogleAds and sold an infoproduct</li>
	  <li>During my first aerospace job, coded a software in VisualBasic for managing Ground System Tests for the Aircrafts we were producing. <br>It literally skyrocketed my career in the aerospace industry.</li>
	</ul>
  </p>

  <H2>Why Startup Institute and what can I bring in?</h2> 
  <p>I would like to switch careers completely to boost my current web development skills (that I consider very weak) while entering into the tech-startup scene. My big dream is to found a startup myself with whoever I meet who will be willing to take up the challenge. </p>
  <p>Although my web development skills are not robust, my soft-skills and personal habits made me a key trump card. These are the recurring traits that people tell me when I ask for feedback:<br>
 	<ul>
	  <li>I am curious and always eager to learn new things (lifelong learner)</li>
	  <li>I am open, transparent, extremely social, and cannot fake who I realy am :)</li>
	  <li>I am creative and tipically the one that comes up with all those extravagant crazy ideas!</li>
	  <li>I never give up when I jump into a project I love</li>
	  <li>I take action</li>
	  <li>I extremely like bringing people together from different backgrounds to achieve awesoness as part of a team</li>
	 </ul>
  </p>

<p>I have to admit that all this website was done a little "quick & dirty" and under 3 hours. I hope you know me a little better now, personally and technically, and I look forward to hearing from you guys!<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>Carlos Lopez</p>
