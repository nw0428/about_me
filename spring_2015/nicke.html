        <p>
          I am an entrepreneur that has always loved examining different ways of viewing the world or doing things and breaking them down to their absolute core. To view it with a beginner's mind. From there it becomes an exciting journey coming up with something more useful, more beautiful, something that makes more sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my life I have combined this devotion to seeing things differently with a laser-like focused attention to concentrated fields that I am extremely passionate about (i.e. film, education, computer science).
        </p>
        <p>
I am also an autodidact who has found a lot of joy diving head first into a subject I previously knew nothing about. Coming out the other end as a much brighter person with a completely new outlook of the world. For example, one soft skill that I have done this with is charisma. Previously a shy, introverted kid, I began observing other charismatic people and emulating some of the core aspects of where their talents came from. After years of doing this, I have developed communication skills that are as unconscious as breathing.
