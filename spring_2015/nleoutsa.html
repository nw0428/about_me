        <li><h4 class="info">I love to learn and create.
            I was born in Boston, grew up in central Florida, and find myself once again in wonderful New England studying Web Development.
            In my free time I love to practice oil painting and woodworking.
            I was introduced to Python and C++ while studying Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
            Since then, I've done some independent study in the field, including reading
            "Digital Design and Computer Architecture," through which I learned a bit about C,
            assembly languages, and how they communicate with the machine down to the lowest levels of logic gates and transistors.
            I've had some time to play around on Project Euler where users solve increasingly difficult
            math puzzles through programming and am currently attending
            the <a href="http://www.startupinstitute.com/?region=boston">StartUp Institute</a> in Boston, MA.
            I've been learning Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and an assortment of other tools to help me create awesome web apps.
            Please check out my <a href="https://github.com/nleoutsa">Github</a> for a look at what I'm working on, such as
            <a href="https://morning-retreat-6114.herokuapp.com/">SimpleTEXT</a>, an easy to use text messaging web app using the Twilio API, or <a href="https://cities.bitballoon.com">Cities</a>, a pixelated JavaScript game that lets you draw city scapes simply by clicking and dragging!
