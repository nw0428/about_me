    <h2>OK OK The Serious Stuff: (A little sneaky peak at my LinkedIn)</h2>
        <p>
        	I have studied Python and Java, and am currently working on mastering Visual Basic, C++, C#, and Lua. It has long been a goal of mine to move towards the technical side of things and I have been spending much of my free time improving my programming skill set. I am passionate about solving problems with code and doing what needs to be done to grow my skills. I ultimately want to take any step that brings me closer to programming and/or creating interactive software.
        </p>
        <p>
        	I'm currently attending the web developing track at Startup Institute, the land of rainbows and candy sprinkles.
